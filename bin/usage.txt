Usage: ngzip {OPTIONS} [file]

Description:

     The gzip program compresses and decompresses a file using Lempel-Ziv
     coding (LZ77).  If no file is specified, gzip will compress from
     standard input, or decompress to standard output.  When in
     compression mode, file will be written to another file with
     the suffix, set by the -S suffix option, added, if possible.

     In decompression mode, file will be checked for existence, as
     will the file with the suffix added.  The file argument must contain
     a separate complete archive.

Standard Options:

 -c, --stdout, --to-stdout

  This option specifies that output will go to the standard output stream,
  leaving files intact.

 -d, --decompress, --uncompress

  This option selects decompression rather than compression.

 -S suffix, --suffix suffix

  This option changes the default suffix from .gz to suffix.

 -h, --help
