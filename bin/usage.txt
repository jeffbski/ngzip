Usage: ngzip {OPTIONS} [file] > file.gz

Description:

     The ngzip program compresses and decompresses a file using Lempel-Ziv
     coding (LZ77). ngzip will compress or decompress from standard input
     to standard output. If a file parameter is provided ngzip will read
     from the file and write to stdout. The default compression level is
     slightly biased toward higher compression at expense of speed.

Standard Options:

 -d, --decompress, --uncompress

  This option selects decompression rather than compression.

 -1, --fast

  Use the fastest compression method (less compression). Only relevant when in compression mode.

 -9, --best

  Use the maximum compression method at the expense of speed. Only relevant when in compression mode.

 -h, --help
